    <h1>GoHelp</h1>
    <p>Use this document to get started with the GoFetch dashboard. <br/> 
    Click on the topics on the left to find more information.</p>
    
    <span id="clients">
    <h2>Working With Client Data</h2>
    </span>
    <span id = "new_urls"> 
<h3>Entering a New Target URL</h3>
    </span>
    <p>Something about entering a new target URL - client's domain or competitor URL...
    You're id will be associated with the entry, so you will need to be logged into Chrome. If you are not logged in, you will need to log into GoFetch.</p>
    <span id = "new_links"> 
    <h3>Entering New Links</h3>
    </span>
    <p>There are several options for entering links:</p>
    <ol> 
    <li>
    Right-Clicking The Link In The Browser: 
    </li>
    <ol>
    <li>Make sure you have the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/propellernet-power-plugin/kknokjakaddebpadkaphfcjlkpmcinio">GoFetch Chrome Plug in</a> installed.  </li>
    <li>
    Right-click on the link and select "Save This Link" from the context menu.
    </li>
     <li>
    You will be presented with the links entry form, with several of the fields pre-populated based on the link you selected in the previous step.
    </li>
     <li>
    Add any missing details (Link Building Activity, Campaign, etc) and check that all the information is correct.
    </li>
     <li>
    Click the "Add Links" button. 	
    </li>
    </ol>
    <li> Manually Enter Link(s) Via The Link Entry Form: </li>
    <ol>
    <li>
    Select the "URLs/Links" button in the top navigation bar
    </li>
    <li>
    In the form header: from left to the right, select: Client, Campaign (optional) and Target URL from the drop down menus. 
    </li>
    <li>
    In the main entry form, select Link Building Activity; and enter: the date of the link, the backlink URL and anchor text.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you have more than one link to enter a new tab will appear once you have entered the anchor text. This tab will have a number of fields pre-populated based on the link details you just entered. Open this tab, fill in the missing details and check that all the information is correct.
    </li>
    <li>
    Repeat the above step until you have entered all your new links.
    </li>
    <li>
    Press the "Add Links" button.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <li>
    Drag 'n' Drop An Excel WorkBook Of Links:
    <br> This option allows you to bulk upload a number of historical links in one conveniant step.
    </li>
    <ol>
    <li>
    Make sure that your excel document follows the following formatting rules, so that GoFetch can digest the data:
    <ol>
    <li>
    The Whole Workbook: should be named after the client these links are associated with (ex: marksandspencers.xls)
    </li>
    <li>
    Sheets: If the client has individual associated campaigns, then each sheet in the workbook should be named after these campaigns (ex: Sheet1 = "Dresses", Sheet2 = "Shoes", etc). If the client has no campaigns, just leave the title of the sheet as "Sheet1". GoFetch will know that this client has no campaigns.
    </li>
    <li>
    Column Headers: Each sheet should have columns (in any order) with the following header titles: "URL" (this is the backlink URL), "Date", "Anchor Text", "Target URL", "Link Activity" (this can be one of: Blogger Relations, Content Creation, Directories, Link Chase, Media Relations, News Wires, Niche Communities or Partnerships)
    </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
    Once you have the workbook in the correct format, either drag 'n' drop it into the 
    upload area or click the &quot;Choose&quot; button and browse and open it from your local machine. </li>
    <li>
    Click the "Upload" button to upload the workbook to GoFetch.
    </li>
    <li>
    GoFetch will create a new link entry in the link entry form, one for each link in the workbook. Check through all the entries to make sure there are no errors.
    </li>
    <li>
    Press the "Add Links" button.
    </li>
    </ol>
    <li>Appending To The End Of The Client's Links Table:
    <br/> Much as you would work with an excel document, you can add a new link to the last empty row in the client's link table. </li>
    <ol>
    <li>Simply fill in all required details in the last empty row in the client's list of links. GoFetch will add this to the client's link profile and it will appear in subsequent queries.</li>
    </ol>
    </ol>
    
     <h3>Querying Clients' URLs and Social Data</h3>
    <p>When you select a client (or clients: for a multi-client comparison) in the ("Select a client to begin") drop down menu, you will see their name appear in the left-hand column.  
    <br> In this column, click on the client name to show all associated target URLs. Click on individual URLs to see their backlink and social data in the main dashboard window.</p> 
    
    <span id="reports">
    <h2>Producing Reports</h2>
    </span>
    <p>All reports are produced by first entering all the links that the client has (see: <a href="#new_links">Enter New Links.</a>) 
        	<ol> 
        	<li>Select the client you want to produce the report for as described above. All the client's links will be displayed in the table in the main dashboard window.</li>
            
            <li>
            Use the filters above the table to sort the table and ease the selection of links that you want to include in the report. Filter by: DA, Link Building Activity, etc. 
            </li>
            
            <li>
            Select links to include in the report by selected the checkboxes to their right. You can also select all visible links by checking this box at the top-left of the table.
            
            </li>
            
            <li>
            All the link information is editable, so if you notice incorrect data, you can just edit this directly in the table. Also you can add a new link to this client's link profile by filling in the empty row at the bottom of the table, much as you would if you were working with an excel document.
            </li>
            
    <li>
    Now follow the instructions below for different reports: 
    </li>
            </ol>

    </p>
    <h3>Producing a Coverage Book Report</h3>
    
    	<ol> 

            
            <li>
            So now you have all the links you want in the final report selected. Select the "Create Report" button/menu and select "Coverage Book"
            </li>
            
            <li>
            A new window will open with an initial Coverage Book created using the links and client data you have selected in the previous steps. The scrollable Coverage Book is in the middle of the page. On the right is a toolbox with tools you will use to crop the backlink webpages' images and highlight the links that point to the client.
            </li>
            
            <li>
             All the information on each page is editable, as for some links you may not want social data (if, for example, its particulary poor), so you can just delete this field and it will not appear in the final report.
            </li>
            
            <li>
            Editing Link Images: Every link will have its image present in the centre of the page. You can crop this image to suit your requirements. 
            <ul>
            <li>If the image is too wide: select the crop tool from the tool box and draw vertically over the left or right	 sides of the image to cut that area away. 
            </li>
            <li>If the image is too long: use the crop tool and drag horizontally across the whole length of the image where you want to make a cut. The image will split and the bottom half will be placed on a newly created page. 
            </li>
            <li>
            Repeat until you are happy. 
            </li>
            <li>
            If you have made an error and want the original image back, click the small undo button on the top left of the image to return to the original image.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
            Highlighting The Link: Select the highlight tool in the tool box (the red rectangle). Draw a box over the link.
            
            </li>
            
            <li>
            Saving / Exporting your report: You have now edited all data, cropped the images and highlighted all the links. On the tool box select the "Save As" button and download and save your report. An editable copy will also be saved in your personal account space in case you want to edit the report later. A "virtual URL" will be presented which will allow you share the report online with clients (see wordpress example...).
            </li>
    
    	</ol>
